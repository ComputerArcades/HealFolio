\section*{Introduction}

\setlength\parindent{24pt}

The team will be designing software (HealFolio) that will be aimed at improving service delivery for all types of medical practitioners. Specifically the filling system currently used by medical practitioners, helping them make better diagnosis, prescriptions and so on. We have identified and listed below the needs and the particular solutions that we will address in this project.

\section*{Needs}

A central filling system that helps any patient that needs medical attention, empowering them in going to any medical practitioner and with HealFolio the patient’s medical history will be organized for easy access. The client will also be able to keep record of prescriptions from pharmacies with the patient’s feedback on how the treatment worked, with this information the system can keep track of which prescriptions have worked effectively for certain diagnoses, hence our client can use the information as a guideline at the later stages when the product is fully developed. Furthermore, if the client is also concerned about patients using third party’s medical aids as their own, this system can point them towards recommended doctors that will be able to treat them effectively.

\section*{Solutions}

Our team will design this program that will run on PC platform (like Linux), as the software will be launched on laptop or personal computers and with further development other devices like mobile and tablets can be added for release. \\

\noindent \large \textit{Key features:} \\

\begin{itemize}

\item Only users with administration rights are allowed to enter new patient info or update the patient information.

\item The system should keep record of the user activities in the system, like the time they last accessed patient records.

\item Patient feedback will also be updated by users with admin rights.

\item The system should be able to keep record of all the practitioners a patient visit.

\item The system will have a central database that can be accessed by all the practitioners using the software.

\item The system should keep all records of prescriptions for all patients and track which ones have worked successfully. \\

\end{itemize}

\noindent \large \textit{Additional features:} \\

\begin{itemize}

\item The system should be able to keep track of available inventory, and alert the particular practitioner if they’re about to run out of medical suppliers.

\item Patients will be identified by their fingerprints, as a security measure to make sure the rightful account holders.

\item Patients will have their own platform where they can give feedback of the treatment and rate the service of practitioners they have been given.

\item The system should generate medical certificates for the time patients where at the practitioner of their choice, if needed by work and/or educational institutions.

\end{itemize}
