As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }

ef foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
