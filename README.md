Summary
-------

The results of the requirements elicitation and the analysis activities are docu-
mented in the Requirements Analysis Document (RAD). This document com-
pletely describes the system in terms of functional and nonfunctional require-
ments and serves as a contractual basis between the customer and the developer.
The RAD must be written in the language of the customer’s domain of busi-
ness/expertise. Under no circumstances should any "computerese" terminology
creep into this document.

Audience
--------

The audience for the RAD includes the customer, the users, the project man-
agement, the system analysts (i.e., the developers who participate in the re-
quirements), and the system designers (i.e., the developers who participate in
the system design). The first part of the document, including use cases and
nonfunctional requirements, is written during requirements elicitation.  The
formalization of the specification in terms of object models is written during
analysis. We use an example template for a RAD introduced in the book.

# 1 Introduction

The first section of the RAD is an Introduction. Its purpose is to provide a brief
overview of the function of the system and the reasons for its development, its
scope, and references to the development context (e.g., reference to the prob-
lem statement written by the client, references to existing systems, feasibility
studies). The introduction also includes the objectives and success criteria of
the project.

### 1.1 Purpose of the system

### 1.2 Scope of the system

### 1.3 Objectives and success criteria of the project

### 1.4 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations

### 1.5 References

### 1.6 Overview

# 2 Current system

The second section, Current system, describes the current state of affairs. If the
new system will replace an existing system, this section describes the function-
ality and the problems of the current system. Otherwise, this section describes
how the tasks supported by the new system are accomplished now.

# 3 Proposed system

The third section documents the requirements elicitation and the analysis model
of the new system.

### 3.1 Overview

The overview presents a functional overview of the system.

### 3.2 Functional requirements ("shall lists")

Functional requirements describes the high-level functionality of the system.

##### 3.2.1 -

##### 3.2.2 -

##### 3.2.3 -

### 3.3 Nonfunctional requirements

Nonfunctional requirements describes user-level requirements that are not di-
rectly related to functionality. This includes usability, reliability, performance,
supportability, implementation, interface, operational, packaging, and legal re-
quirements.

##### 3.3.1 Usability

##### 3.3.2 Reliability

##### 3.3.3 Performance

##### 3.3.4 Supportability

##### 3.3.5 Implementation

##### 3.3.6 Interface

##### 3.3.7 Packaging

##### 3.3.8 Legal

### 3.4 System models

System models describes the scenarios, use cases, object model, and dynamic
models for the system.  This section contains the complete functional spec-
ification, including mock-ups illustrating the user interface of the system and
navigational paths representing the sequence of screens. The subsections Object
model and Dynamic model are written during the Analysis activity.

##### 3.4.1 Scenarios

##### 3.4.2 Use case model

##### 3.4.3 Analysis object model

##### 3.4.4 Dynamic model

##### 3.4.5 User interface—navigational paths and screen mock-ups

# 4 Glossary

A glossary of important terms, to ensure consistency in the specification and to
ensure that we use the client’s terms. A precursor to the Data Dictionary.
